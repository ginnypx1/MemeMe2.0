MemeMe 2.0

Initial Review 3/9/17:

Requires Changes: 

General: 7/8
There's no Meme Detail page
-- I somehow misunderstood that the meme detail page wasn't the meme editor. I have now added this page to the project, along with a segue so you can edit the meme from the meme detail page.

Meme Editor: 13/13

Sent Memes: 2/4
There is supposed to be a meme detail view to display the memes. I have now made that change.
The detail slides in from right to left, with a back arrow in the top left corner to lead back to the table collection view. That has been added along with the specific meme detail page.

Code Review Comments:

MemeTextFieldDelegate.swift:
line 32 - Awesome! For abstracting the repetitive code to set up the various attributes of the top and bottom text.

MemeEditorImagePickerDelegateExtension.swift:
line 14 - Awesome! For abstracting the repetitive code to chose an image, either from the Camera or Album.

MemeModel.swift:
line 17 - suggestion: you should consider converting all these five variables into constants. I have now made that change.
*** MY NOTE: fontName needs to be a var in order for the meme to have a default Impact font but allow the user to change it ***

MemeMeEditorViewController:
line 78 - Awesome! NicelyDone (re: showToolbars function)

MemeEditorKeyboardExtension.swift:
line 21 - Suggestion: No need to have an else if statement in here... also a better way to slide up view is
func keyboardWillShow(_ notification: Notification) {
    if bottomTextField.isFirstResponder {
        view.frame.origin.y = getKeyboardHeight(notification) * (-1)
    }
}
I have now made this change.

MemeCollectionViewController.swift:
line 53 - Awesome! The flow layout looks good.
